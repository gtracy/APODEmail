    <p>Zoinks!</p>
    <br/><p>A bit of a false start this week, eh? Some of you received an empty email and others received nothing. There are a couple of kinks still to be worked out, and I'm looking at those now.</p>
    <br/><p>This should be back on autopilot again as it was before. Thanks for your patience as I make the transition over to the new infrastructure.</p>
    <br/><p>Cheers.</p>
